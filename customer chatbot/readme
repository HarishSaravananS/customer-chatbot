# ðŸ›’ Customer Service Assistant - Electronics Store

This project is a **Streamlit-based AI chatbot** that serves as a customer service assistant for an electronics store. It uses **LangChain**, **Groq's LLaMA model**, and **conversation memory** to extract product information and respond to user queries in a friendly and context-aware manner.

## Features

- **Dynamic Product Extraction**: Identifies products and categories mentioned in customer queries.
- **Contextual Responses**: Maintains conversation history to generate relevant and follow-up responses.
- **Memory Management**: Uses `ConversationBufferMemory` for efficient state management.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Streamlit UI for seamless user interaction.

## Tech Stack

- **Python**: Main programming language.
- **Streamlit**: For building the interactive web app.
- **LangChain**: For managing LLM chains and memory.
- **Groq API**: Powered by the LLaMA-3.3-70b Versatile model.
- **Environment Management**: `os` for API key handling.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/customer-service-assistant.git
   cd customer-service-assistant
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # For Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Requirements**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set Your API Key**
   - Add your **Groq API key** as an environment variable:
     ```bash
     export GROQ_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
     ```

5. **Run the App**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## How It Works

### Step 1: **Extract Categories and Products**
- **Input**: A user query (e.g., *"Tell me about the SmartX ProPhone and cameras."*).
- **Prompt**: A predefined `PromptTemplate` extracts relevant products and categories.
- **Output**: A structured list of products and categories.

```json
[
  {"products": ["SmartX ProPhone"], "category": "Smartphones and Accessories"},
  {"products": ["FotoSnap DSLR Camera"], "category": "Cameras and Camcorders"}
]
```

### Step 2: **Generate Contextual Responses**
- Uses **conversation memory** to maintain chat history.
- Combines the current query with past interactions to generate a contextual, user-friendly response.

## Prompt Chaining and Scalability

### **Prompt Chaining**
Prompt chaining allows modular interaction between prompts for structured and scalable workflows:
1. **Extraction Chain**: Identifies products/categories using a structured output format.
2. **Response Chain**: Generates friendly and concise responses based on extracted data and conversation history.

This separation ensures clean and **modular logic** that can be extended easily.

### **Scalability**
1. **Dynamic Queries**: The app adapts to different product queries seamlessly.
2. **Modularity**: Adding more products or categories requires minimal code changes.
3. **Memory Integration**: The `ConversationBufferMemory` ensures the assistant maintains context for multi-turn conversations.

## Token Efficiency and Optimization

1. **Selective Outputs**:
   - **Extract Chain**: Outputs only product and category names as a list (reduces unnecessary tokens).
   - **Response Chain**: Uses memory to concatenate minimal context with user queries.
   
2. **Prompt Optimization**:
   - Templates focus on concise and direct instructions.
   - Redundant explanations and verbose outputs are avoided.

3. **Memory Management**:
   - Memory buffers are kept minimal, storing only necessary chat history.

## Example Usage

**User Input**:
```
Tell me about the SmartX ProPhone and the FotoSnap DSLR Camera.
```

**Assistant Response**:
```
The SmartX ProPhone is a high-performance smartphone with advanced features. 
The FotoSnap DSLR Camera is an excellent choice for professional photography. 
Are you looking for accessories or something else?
```

## Future Improvements

- **Token Optimization**: Further reduce context token usage for long conversations.
- **Multi-LLM Support**: Integrate fallback models for robustness.
- **Product Recommendations**: Add personalized suggestions based on user queries.
- **API Integration**: Connect to product databases for real-time updates.
